# Design Document

## Overview

The search optimization feature will transform the current sequential, all-or-nothing scraping approach into an intelligent, concurrent system that dynamically adapts scraping behavior based on query analysis and real-time quality assessment. The design implements a multi-layered optimization strategy focusing on concurrent processing, intelligent source selection, adaptive content extraction, and dynamic summary generation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Query Analyzer**: Analyzes incoming queries to determine complexity, domain, and expected response characteristics
2. **Source Ranker**: Scores and prioritizes search results before scraping based on relevance and quality indicators
3. **Concurrent Scraper Manager**: Manages parallel scraping operations with timeout and error handling
4. **Content Quality Assessor**: Evaluates scraped content quality and relevance in real-time
5. **Adaptive Summary Generator**: Generates summaries with appropriate length and detail based on query analysis
6. **Caching Layer**: Implements intelligent caching for recently scraped content
7. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures and manages service degradation gracefully

### Data Flow

```
Query → Query Analyzer → Search → Source Ranker → Concurrent Scraper Manager
                                                           ↓
Content Quality Assessor ← Scraped Content ← Multiple Scrapers (Parallel)
           ↓
Adaptive Summary Generator → Final Response
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Query Analyzer

**Purpose**: Analyzes query characteristics to inform downstream optimization decisions

**Interface**:
```python
class QueryAnalysis:
    complexity: QueryComplexity  # SIMPLE, MODERATE, COMPLEX
    domain: Optional[str]        # detected domain (tech, health, etc.)
    intent: QueryIntent          # FACTUAL, RESEARCH, COMPARISON, etc.
    expected_length: SummaryLength  # SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG
    recency_importance: float    # 0.0-1.0 score for how important recent info is

class QueryAnalyzer:
    def analyze_query(self, query: str) -> QueryAnalysis
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use keyword analysis and pattern matching to detect query complexity
- Implement domain detection using keyword dictionaries and ML classification
- Analyze query structure (questions, comparisons, etc.) to determine intent

### Source Ranker

**Purpose**: Prioritizes search results before scraping to focus on highest-value sources

**Interface**:
```python
class SourceScore:
    url: str
    relevance_score: float      # 0.0-1.0
    authority_score: float      # 0.0-1.0
    freshness_score: float      # 0.0-1.0
    final_score: float          # weighted combination

class SourceRanker:
    def rank_sources(self, search_results: List[dict], query_analysis: QueryAnalysis) -> List[SourceScore]
```

**Scoring Factors**:
- Domain authority (based on known high-quality domains)
- URL structure quality (depth, parameters, etc.)
- Title relevance to query
- Snippet content quality
- Publication date (when available)
- Source type (news, academic, blog, etc.)

### Concurrent Scraper Manager

**Purpose**: Manages parallel scraping with intelligent timeout and error handling

**Interface**:
```python
class ScrapingResult:
    url: str
    success: bool
    content: Optional[dict]
    error: Optional[str]
    duration: float

class ConcurrentScraperManager:
    def scrape_sources_parallel(
        self, 
        ranked_sources: List[SourceScore], 
        max_concurrent: int = 5,
        timeout_per_source: int = 10
    ) -> List[ScrapingResult]
```

**Features**:
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Per-source timeout handling
- Graceful error handling and logging
- Early termination when sufficient quality content is gathered

### Content Quality Assessor

**Purpose**: Evaluates content quality and relevance in real-time to optimize scraping decisions

**Interface**:
```python
class ContentQuality:
    relevance_score: float      # 0.0-1.0
    content_length: int
    information_density: float  # 0.0-1.0
    duplicate_content: bool
    quality_indicators: Dict[str, float]

class ContentQualityAssessor:
    def assess_content(self, content: dict, query_analysis: QueryAnalysis) -> ContentQuality
    def should_continue_scraping(self, gathered_content: List[ContentQuality]) -> bool
```

**Quality Metrics**:
- Content length and structure
- Keyword relevance to query
- Information density (text vs. noise ratio)
- Duplicate detection across sources
- Content freshness and accuracy indicators

### Adaptive Summary Generator

**Purpose**: Generates summaries with appropriate length and detail based on query characteristics

**Interface**:
```python
class SummaryConfig:
    target_length: int          # target word count
    detail_level: DetailLevel   # CONCISE, BALANCED, COMPREHENSIVE
    focus_areas: List[str]      # key topics to emphasize
    include_examples: bool

class AdaptiveSummaryGenerator:
    def generate_summary(
        self, 
        query: str, 
        sources: List[dict], 
        query_analysis: QueryAnalysis
    ) -> str
```

**Adaptive Logic**:
- Simple factual queries → 100-200 words, bullet points
- Research queries → 300-600 words, structured paragraphs
- Comparison queries → 400-800 words, comparative analysis
- Dynamic adjustment based on available content quality and quantity

## Data Models

### Enhanced Source Data Model
```python
class EnhancedSource:
    url: str
    title: str
    main_content: str
    images: List[dict]
    categories: List[str]
    # New fields for optimization
    content_quality: ContentQuality
    scraping_duration: float
    relevance_score: float
    word_count: int
    last_updated: Optional[datetime]
```

### Caching Models
```python
class CachedContent:
    url: str
    content: EnhancedSource
    cached_at: datetime
    query_hash: str
    expiry_time: datetime

class CacheManager:
    def get_cached_content(self, url: str, query: str) -> Optional[CachedContent]
    def cache_content(self, content: EnhancedSource, query: str, ttl: int = 3600)
```

## Error Handling

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implement circuit breaker for AI synthesis services
- Track failure rates and automatically switch to fallback modes
- Gradual recovery when services become available again

### Graceful Degradation
- Continue processing with partial results when some sources fail
- Provide informative error messages without exposing internal failures
- Maintain service availability even during high error rates

### Retry Strategies
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Different retry policies for different types of errors
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with concurrent requests to validate response time improvements
- Stress testing to ensure system stability under high load
- Benchmark testing to measure optimization gains

### Quality Testing
- A/B testing to compare summary quality before and after optimization
- Relevance testing to validate source ranking effectiveness
- User acceptance testing for summary length appropriateness

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing of the complete optimized pipeline
- Error injection testing to validate error handling
- Cache effectiveness testing

### Unit Testing
- Individual component testing for all new modules
- Mock testing for external dependencies
- Edge case testing for query analysis and content assessment

## Performance Targets

- **Response Time**: 90% of queries complete within 5 seconds
- **Concurrency**: Support up to 5 parallel scraping operations
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Achieve 20-30% cache hit rate for repeated queries
- **Error Resilience**: Maintain 95% success rate even with 20% source failures
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduce average scraping operations by 30-40% through intelligent selection
