# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the existing multi-source research API to deliver faster, more reliable search results with intelligent scraping capabilities. The optimization will implement smart content filtering, adaptive scraping strategies, and dynamic summary sizing based on query context to improve both performance and result quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API user, I want search results to be returned faster, so that I can get information quickly without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search query is submitted THEN the system SHALL return results within 5 seconds for 90% of queries
2. WHEN multiple sources are being scraped THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently to reduce total response time
3. WHEN a source takes longer than 10 seconds to respond THEN the system SHALL timeout and continue with other sources
4. IF a source has been successfully scraped recently THEN the system SHALL use cached content when appropriate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API user, I want the system to scrape only the most relevant sites for my query, so that I get high-quality results without unnecessary processing overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing search results THEN the system SHALL score and rank sources by relevance before scraping
2. WHEN a query is domain-specific THEN the system SHALL prioritize authoritative sources for that domain
3. WHEN search results contain low-quality sources THEN the system SHALL filter them out before scraping
4. IF a source has poor content quality indicators THEN the system SHALL skip scraping that source
5. WHEN determining scraping targets THEN the system SHALL limit to the top 10-15 most relevant sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API user, I want summaries that are appropriately sized for my query, so that I get comprehensive information without overwhelming detail or insufficient context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is simple and factual THEN the system SHALL generate concise summaries (100-200 words)
2. WHEN a query is complex or research-oriented THEN the system SHALL generate detailed summaries (300-600 words)
3. WHEN a query asks for comparison or analysis THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive summaries (400-800 words)
4. IF source content is limited THEN the system SHALL adjust summary length accordingly
5. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL maintain information density without unnecessary verbosity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API user, I want the system to be more reliable in handling failures, so that I consistently get results even when some sources are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual sources fail to load THEN the system SHALL continue processing other sources
2. WHEN the AI synthesis service fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
3. WHEN all primary AI services fail THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback response using available content
4. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while maintaining user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API user, I want the system to intelligently determine scraping depth, so that it gathers sufficient information without over-processing irrelevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query requires recent information THEN the system SHALL prioritize newer sources and limit scraping of older content
2. WHEN a query is about a specific topic THEN the system SHALL focus scraping on content sections most relevant to that topic
3. WHEN content quality is high in initial sources THEN the system SHALL reduce the number of additional sources scraped
4. IF initial sources provide comprehensive coverage THEN the system SHALL stop scraping additional sources early
5. WHEN content overlap is detected across sources THEN the system SHALL avoid scraping redundant information
